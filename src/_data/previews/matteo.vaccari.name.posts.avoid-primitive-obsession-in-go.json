Consider this code:\ntype User struct { FirstName string LastName string Email string } We’re using the type string everywhere. If we wanted a function to create a new user, its signature would be obtuse:\nfunc NewUser(first, last, email string) User { ... } It’s easy to get confused and swap first and last name, or worse. The smell is called “primitive obsession” because we tend to use primitive types such as strings or integers for everything.","url":"https://matteo.vaccari.name/posts/avoid-primitive-obsession-in-go/","logo":{"url":"https://matteo.vaccari.name/favicon.ico","type":"ico","size":1406,"height":16,"width":16,"size_pretty":"1.41 kB"}},"statusCode":200,"headers":{"accept-ranges":"bytes","access-control-allow-origin":"*","age":"0","cache-control":"max-age=600","content-encoding":"gzip","content-length":"4573","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","date":"Thu, 28 Mar 2024 22:04:37 GMT","etag":"W/\"6605d22b-5575\"","expires":"Thu, 28 Mar 2024 22:14:36 GMT","last-modified":"Thu, 28 Mar 2024 20:25:15 GMT","server":"GitHub.com","vary":"Accept-Encoding","via":"1.1 varnish","x-cache":"HIT","x-cache-hits":"1","x-fastly-request-id":"4ab63b587555d4e0444810db9b80b4b1cac4ba79","x-github-request-id":"2C34:2B4087:F38514:137D161:6605E973","x-proxy-cache":"MISS","x-served-by":"cache-ewr18130-EWR","x-timer":"S1711663477.016130,VS0,VE1"}}
