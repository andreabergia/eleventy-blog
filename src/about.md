I am an Italian software engineer, and I have been working as a principal software engineer for quite a few years. I loved computers since I can remember, and I have started programming when I was a kid in Basic. Since there, life has been a continuous process of learning technologies and programming languages.

I have written production code in Rust, Kotlin, Java, C++, TypeScript, Python, C#, and quite a few other languages. I have used lots of different frameworks and technologies, and I am always on the lookout for new ones to try.

I am currently employed by [ServiceNow](https://servicenow.com) as a Sr Staff Software Engineer, working as a compiler engineer on the JavaScript engine.

I am married, and we have a wonderful daughter. We also own two gorgeous cats, [Johnny](/images/about/johnny.jpg) and [Leaf](/images/about/leaf.jpg), who are the origin of lots of fun, laughter, cuddling, and hair. So much hair.

Like most Italians, I love a good cup of espresso, but not the watery thing that foreigners call "coffee". This is one instance where I believe that 98% of humanity is wrong! :) I also love tea and herb infuses, and I drink quite a few cups daily. I can't code without some warm water, basically.

I live in north-western Italy, near the gorgeous [Torino](https://www.turismotorino.org/). I enjoy cooking, reading, music, photography, and video games.
