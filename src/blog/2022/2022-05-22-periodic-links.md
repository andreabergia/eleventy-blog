Hello, and welcome to a new edition of _Links lists!_ Rust and some history this week!

## Coding

### Rust in the kernel

Many people are advocating for integrating Rust in the Linux kernel, which is written (mostly) in C and assembler.

Rust is famous for its [memory](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/meet-safe-and-unsafe.html) [safety](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2022/03/18/programming-security-and-why-rust) guarantees, which is why many people find that it could have a place for writing kernels and drivers. In particular, Google has setup a public prototype and has an interesting post on a sample driver written in Rust. Here are a couple of links.

Also, if you wanna have fun, look up [what Linus Torvalds thinks of C++!](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/linus-torvalds-c-is-really-a-terrible-language-2248b839bee3) Here's the [original email,](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linus) written in the usual polite and calm tone Torvalds is famous for! :-)

### Indexes in Postgres

A quick, but good introduction about the various kinds of indexes in PostgreSQL.

### History of containers

An old (2015), but interesting history about the origin of containers from Red Hat.

## Non-coding

### Plastic

A long, rather opinionated, but very interesting article I've read recently about the history of plastic.
