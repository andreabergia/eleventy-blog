Hello, and welcome to a new edition of _Links lists!_ C++, Rust, Kubernetes and careers this week!

## Coding

### Optimizing C++ `std::sort` at Google scale

The algorithm in the STL of C++ are very powerful and _very_ widely used. This article is a very in-depth look at how and why Google modified the implementation of `std::sort`. The changes have been merged in LLVM and will be available to everyone soon.

### Rust

I (unfortunately) haven not written much Rust, but I belive it is a _very_ interesting programming language. Here is an example of the [newtype](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/patterns/behavioural/newtype.html) pattern.

## Infrastructure

### Kustomize

A tool I have recently discovered is [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/), which is actually a part of `kubectl`. I've found the following slide deck to be very clear in explaining how it works and what problem it solves.

## Careers

There was a time when, after being a senior engineer for a few years, the only realistic next step in your career was to become an engineer manager. Which is _not_ ideal, because you end up with one less good engineer and (often) with a bad manager - as the two jobs require widely different skills, and few people excel at both.

Luckily, in the past few years, the _individual contributor path_ is something that has become pretty common. It allows great engineers to keep on progressing on and become technical leads, staff engineers, principal engineers, and so on. Here are a couple of links on the topic.

### The different career paths

A good explanation of some of the possible career paths after senior engineer. The terminology used in this article is quite common, in my experience.

### The difference between technical lead and engineering manager

A short, but well written example of the different responsibilities between an _engineering manager_ and a _technical lead_.
