I often thought about my blog. I would find myself reading some interesting articles and thinking "oh I should link that from my blog". But, then, laziness, work, and life won, and my blog stayed untouched.

I opened the source code, and I was shocked to find I had not posted anything in almost six years. If you had asked me, I would have answered "two, three years tops"... and yet, the last post was on June 2016. That was shocking, and a bit depressing.

So, here I am, trying to get back into the habit. I've updated the look and feel to a new theme, [Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/), which I think looks *great* on desktop and mobile, in both light and dark styles. I hope you will find it beautiful and readable.

Here is to a new phase of my blogging life! I promise you will hear more from me soon. 🙂
