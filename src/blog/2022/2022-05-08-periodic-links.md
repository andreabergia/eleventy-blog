Hello, and welcome to a new edition of _Links lists!_ Don't miss out on the non-coding link this week!

## Coding

### The test pyramid

A very long, and well done, article about many different kinds of automated testing. Really worthwile read.

### Low level architectures

Two interesting articles about low level architectures. This is how they begin:

> The x86 architecture does things that almost no other modern architecture does, but due to its overwhelming popularity, people think that the x86 way is the normal way and that everybody else is weird.
>
> Let’s get one thing straight: The x86 architecture is the weirdo.

Fun read if you like low level stuff!

## Tools

### Exa

A lovely tool. Slogan: _a modern replacement for `ls`_. Also, I really like the design on its website!

(And yes, of course it is written in Rust.)

## Non coding

### Mechanical watches

You probably have seen this already since it is all over the internet this week, but if you haven't, you _really_ should check out this next link. It is just so incredibily well built, I'm in awe. It is a _fantastic_ explanation of how a mechanical clock works, but even if you do not care in the slightest for the topic, really do spend a couple of minutes to look at how well the explanation it is built.
The animations are incredible, everything is color-coded for clarity, and the text explanation is really well done. A true masterpiece.

It reminds me a bit of the early days of _multimedia_, when we had amazing things such as Microsoft Encarta. I remember being so impressed by an encyclopedia that had vidoes and photos in it!
