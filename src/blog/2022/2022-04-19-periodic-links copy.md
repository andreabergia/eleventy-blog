Hello, and welcome to a new edition of _Links lists!_ No strict "coding" this week, but a few interesting articles about infrastructure and networking.

## Infrastructure

### The value of simulating systems

An interesting article about building simulators, for validating your hypothesis and beliefes. Not something that I have seen discussed often, or indeed thought of doing myself. But it seems like a very promising idea, worth exploring!

### Networking and routers

An interesting article about how routers work. Assumes you know the [OSI model layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model#Layer_architecture).

## Design

### Design basics for developers

If you do a bit of frontend, sometimes you are lucky and you have a designer who gave you a complete design system and mock-ups for every page. Sometimes, however, you don't. Knowing at least some of _the basics_ of designing can be very useful! This is a very good introduction on the theme.
