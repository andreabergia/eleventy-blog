Hello, and welcome to a new post of _Links lists!_ Hope you enjoy this selection. 🙂

## Some tricks of modern CSS

An interesting article about various stuff that can be done with one line of modern CSS. 

As an aside, the fact that you can _actually_ use modern features of CSS (and JS) and expect it to work for pretty much everyone is _so_ good. I remember the days of IE6 dominance... and I don't miss them!

## How to ramp up effectively in a new team or project

Joining a new team, or just a new project, is something that happens pretty often to devs. [Boz](https://boz.com) (the CTO of Meta) has a really great article about how to do it effectively, and fast.

## Headless components in React

An introductory article about building headless components in React, i.e. logic-only components that don't include UI-specific logic. They are useful for building the logic once, and allowing other developers to plug in the UI details and the look & feel. Not something you want to build everyday, but the technique can be useful, and the article is really well written.

## Tool: an improved `git diff`

I've recently started using [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta), which is a _fantastic_ tool to improve display of differences from Git. Highly recommended.
