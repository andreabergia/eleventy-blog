# Tech articles

## How the new GitHub search works

I have really enjoyed this article about how [GitHub](https://github.com)'s new code search works. The scale that GitHub handles is quite impressive - over 115 TB of code! Unsurprisingly, the new search engine is built in Rust 😊

## Actors with Rust and Tokio

A _very_ interesting article about how to implement the [actors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) pattern with Rust and [tokio](https://tokio.rs). Concise and very effective implementation! I like it a lot!

## Are React hooks a bad idea?

I am not an expert in React, but I've tried using [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and I have run into some of the problems described in the following article. It also shows the new [signals](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/react-vs-signals-10-years-later-3k71) approach that some alternative framework are adopting. Very interesting!

## Replace `make` with `just`

I've been using [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) recently instead of a classic `Makefile`... and I'm very happy with it! It's super simple to use, and it does few things - but it does them well! Highly recommended!

## Design documents and reviews

An interesting article by [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net/) about design documents and design reviews.

## Contract testing

At my current employer, [lastminute.com](https://lastminute.com), we are using [Pact](https://docs.pact.io/) for testing the contracts between microservices. It's a tool that requires some effort, but it can help you write tests that go beyond what you could obtain with an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification.

There are a couple of articles on [our tech blog](https://technology.lastminute.com/) on the topic if you are interested.

## How does wealth (and mark-to-market) work

Basic, but interesting article about how "where the wealth goes when markets go down", and what [mark-to-market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marktomarket.asp) means.
