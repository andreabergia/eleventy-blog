## Inventing react server components

Some very interesting articles from [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/) explaining different ways to invent [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components). I loved the different approaches and how clear the articles are.

## Allocators and Arenas in Rust vs Zig

A very interesting article that compares various approaches for allocations in Rust, with a detour to Zig, and explains pretty clearly what an arena is and how to use it.

## Reservoir sampling

A _fantastic_ explanation of the [reservoir sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling) algorithm, with amazing animations. There are a lot of other great visualizations on Sam's website; check them out!

## Newtype pattern

I've blogged about the [Primitive Obsession]({% ref "2022-09-12-primitive-obsession-smell.markdown" %}) code smell in the past, and sometimes I find new good articles about the topic. Here's one that compares C++ and Rust!

## CSS view-transition

From the Safari blog, a simple two-liner of CSS that will (often) improve a website's look, using the modern [view transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API).

## AI going wild

I haven't really blogged about AI, because while I have _opinions_ on the topic, I don't really think I have anything interesting to contribute to the discussion. Besides, I don't know about you, but I feel kinda fed up with the continuous amount of news about it.

But, anyway, here are a few stories of AI going wild that left me pretty depressed.
