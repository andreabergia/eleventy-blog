Hello, and welcome to a new issue of _Links list!_ More non-technical links than usual this time.

## Modern sort algorithms

A _very_ interesting comparison between very data-tailored sort algorithm versus modern generic ones. Spoiler: it's almost never worth writing a specific radix-sort, because generic sorts are _amazing_ and tuned so carefully.

## V8 making JSON.stringify faster

A very interesting blog post from the V8 team on how `JSON.stringify` was made about twice as fast. The craziest thing to me was that adding a `fast-json-iterable` flag on the hidden classes of objects was worth it!

## Modern approach to frontend architecture

I haven't done much frontend in the last couple of years, but this post sounded pretty interesting to me. My blog is [a static website]({% ref "how-is-this-blog-built.md" %}), that loads instantly, and it's something that I'm very proud of.

## Run a browser in the terminal over ssh

[Hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a fantastic website for many reasons, one of which is the _delightful_ little gems that sometimes hit the frontepage, like `term.everything` - a way to run any UI app in a terminal. It's next to useless, but I am so happy it exists!

## What I crave from blogs

I've just noticed that my own little blog has more than one hundred posts by now. It's been incredibly helpful for my career and really fun, and it feels like my way to give back. I have been reading oh so many blogs over the decades and learning _so_ much - my [RSS reader](https://netnewswire.com/) folder contains about 400 sources by now! And I totally agree with the author - the beautiful thing about most personal blogs is that you get the real _voice_ of a person, not company marketing. And that's refreshing, especially compared to your average LinkedIn feed.

## Drinking _every_ cocktail

A very fun read about trying to drink _all_ the cocktails on the official [International Bartender Association](https://iba-world.com/) official cocktail list. Congratulations to Adam, it's not an easy feat apparently!

## No Hello

I have put this as status message in [${crappy chat program I am forced to use}](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) for a while now. It has helped. Your mileage may vary though. 😁
