Hello, and welcome to a new post of _Links lists!_ Hope you enjoy today's selection. 🙂

## Mistakes engineers make in large established codebases

An interesting article about working in large, legacy codebases - something I have been doing for a living most of my career. All the article is very relatable for me. I especially love this quote:

> So you should know how to work in the “legacy mess” because that’s what your company actually does. Good engineering or not, **it’s your job.**

## Translating Java to Kotlin at Scale

Meta has been translating their Android codebase from Java to Kotlin using automated tooling, which they felt was necessary given their scale. It's a very interesting article and technique, but I wonder _why_ they have such a massive Android code base - I was expecting more React Native and just not _that_ much code to be honest.

## Prototyping in Rust

Some simple but useful advice about how to "prototype fast" in Rust. I had already been using some of these ideas on my own projects lately (things like "just use `String` instead of `&str` and dealing with lifetimes"), but there's a lot here.

## Compiler stuff

### Type inference in C++ and Rust

A very interesting and extremely well written article, pointing out the differences in approach between C++ and Rust type inference. It's also a great explanation of why Rust does not have function overload.

### Exponential time complexity in the Swift type checker

Another great article that I discovered while reading the previous one, and explains the various issues that the Swift type checker has due to some (questionable?) design decisions.

### Why Swift’s Type Checker Is So Slow

And yet another article on the same topic.

## SMBC - App

I love the [SMBC](https://www.smbc-comics.com) web comic and I have been reading it for years. This strip was so on point - and so irritating - that I had to share it. 🤣
