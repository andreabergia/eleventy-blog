title: Links list - 2025-07-16

Hello, and welcome to a new issue of _Links list!_ Here are some interesting links I've collected recently.

## Bot or not?

An interesting collection of techniques used to detect whether an HTTP request comes from a browser or from a bot. There's a ton of subtle tricks used!

## Inverse triangle inequality

Yet another interesting article from [Alex Kladov](https://matklad.github.io/)'s blog, this time talking about the analogy between the mathematical triangle inequality and software engineering. I've used the trick of "copy, refactor, then remove original, then rename" many times - I generally start with `Stuff2`, slowly refactor it, then remove the original one and drop the `2` suffix. Works well for me when the refactoring is quite big and is going to take multiple hours / a few days.

## A deep dive into a CPython 3.11 optimization

A really nice illustration of how CPython 3.11 has optimized builtins lookup. It's basically an inline cache, but it's a nice trick and the explanation is great.

## Unusual typographical layouts

These all look interesting and pretty cursed to me, but apparently are all used in some languages/cultures.

## 10x engineers vs 10x teams

An interesting article about how it is a lot more effective to build a well-performing team than hiring a single fantastic engineer. There is one sentence I _really_ agree with:

> It feels good to ship. It feels good to move the business forward. It feels good to sharpen your skills and improve your craft.

Writing code for its own sake can be interesting, but actually _shipping_ is where all the fun happens. Software is only useful if someone is actually _using_ it!

## The tech interview is a legible, reasonably well-designed process

If the title already makes you want to scream, I'm with you. And yet, by the time I finished the article, I was mostly convinced that the industry's hiring practices are not as insane as they seem.

## Enshittification and AI

These three links are pretty long reads about enshittification and the impact of AI. While I don't agree with all their points, there are definitely some valid arguments and there's a lot of food for thought.
